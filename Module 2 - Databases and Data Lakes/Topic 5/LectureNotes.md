# NoSQL 

In a JSON object usually has an array of categories,
Made up of keys and values - a key can have more than one value also , this would be added by an additional nested object 

Curry bracket -  main JSON object
Square bracket - Array of objects

Json also used double quotes to declare Strings

## SQL Databases 

Relational databases - the ‘TABLE’ itself should be related ( not just one common key) 

A table is represented by a two-dimensional table: each column represents a data item, each row represents an observation.

### Why is SQL not sufficient

Not flexlexible , 
big data 


### Enter NoSQL
