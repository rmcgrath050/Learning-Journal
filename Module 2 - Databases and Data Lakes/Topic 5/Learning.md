## Learning 

When it comes to the next module, we will use a lot of Python Notebooks (.ipynb). This is because we can learn the coding language in an easy-to-use format.

The preference here is to use Visual Studio (VS) code (https://code.visualstudio.com/).

With that in mind, I appreciate no everyone will have access. Alternative suggestions that you may have at your company or have access to are:

Google Colab  (https://colab.research.google.com/ )
Anaconda: https://anaconda.org/
PyCharm: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/
Amazon Sagemaker: https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/
Github Codespaces: https://github.com/codespaces  - highly recommended for pushing to github ! 
JupyterLab: https://jupyter.org/

What I'd suggest is:
Find out if you have an internal tool that you use (you will likely have one)
If not, aim for VS Code - it is a Microsoft tool so generally approved
Test it out! Make sure you are comfortable using it
Happy hunting!
