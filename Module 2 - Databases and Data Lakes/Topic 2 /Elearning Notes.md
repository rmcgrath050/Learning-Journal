# Topic 2 - Schemas and integration


## Lession 1 : Topic Introduction to Schemas and Integration

understanding of data warehouses, data marts, and the distinctions between OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) systems.

## Lession 2: Different types Keys and Relationships

Primary and Foreign keys play a pivotal role in maintaining data integrity and establishing relationships between tables. Imagine a scenario where these keys are absent. Without them, our database would descend into chaos. We wouldn’t be able to generate accurate reports or produce valuable insights, as there would be no reliable way to link data from different sources or tables.


## Lession 3: Understanding Schemas and Metadata

what we will learn:
- Make a link from using keys to the emergence of schemas.
- Explore schemas in more depth by explaining different types and meanings schemas, and remember the crucial role of metadata in managing       data, and that schemas are part of metadata.
- Explain star schemas and snowflake schemas and their uses.
- Compare and contrast a star schema with other ways of structuring data, e.g. flat file structure, hierarchical model, etc.


 #### database Schema
 - Describes shape of data and how it relates to other models, tables and databases.
 - examples include Star schema or Snowflake schema
 
 #### SQL Schema
 - A type of database schema that Encompasses functions, indexes, tables and views in a way that uses the Structured Query Language to define the schema.
 - example includes Virtual table comprised of columns and rows with foreign keys and primary keys representing relationship between tables.

 #### AI Schema
 - A framework that standardises how AI models interact with structured data
 - example : In weather prediction, an AI schema might define fields like “temperature”, “humidity”, etc. The AI model’s output, such as { "temperature": 20, "humidity": 80 }, adheres to this schema, making it easily understandable and usable by other systems

 #### SEO Schema
 - Meta information that clearly explains relationships among people, products and thing to web crawlers.
 - example:  Schema markup or labels coded in HTML that add context and share important information about the web pages.

 #### API
- Virtual instructions manual amplifying programming processes.
- API Description Languages (API DL) and OpenAPI standard used to create schema.

### Metal guides to cognitive and process behaviours
- Event schemas
- Object schemas
- Person schema
- Self-schemas
- Social schemas


## Lession 4 : Comparison of SQL Databases

Understanding the nuances between different database systems is crucial for optimising data architecture. Amazon Redshift and PostgreSQL offer distinct advantages, but cater to different needs. 

While PostgreSQL is a widely-used open-source relational database system known for its robustness and flexibility in handling complex SQL operations, Amazon Redshift is a cloud-based data warehousing service optimised for online analytical processing (OLAP) tasks.

However, when choosing a database solution, it is essential to consider vendor-specific differences. These can include unique features, performance optimisations, cost implications, and integration capabilities with other tools and services. 


####  Leanring Activity: Update the learning journal with the following:

- List of databases that you have encountered at work.
- Whether these databases are open-source or not.
- If they are cloud or on-premise.
- Is internal training available in-house on how to use them efficiently.
