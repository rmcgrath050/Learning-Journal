# Object Orientiated Programming 

properties and methods! 

Class is blueprint, object is an instance of this! :) 
inherit behavour and attributes from base object. 

- Constructor is the first thing that is defined - sets up instance
- Constrcutor has the same name as the class - no return type
- Double underscore in phyton shows a dunder method , passing self to apply to its own instance
- Static values - unchangable , fixed values
-
