# 3.2 DevOps : Version Control for Data engineers

##Introduction 

We delve into the world of DevOps, a revolutionary approach that bridges the gap between software development and IT operations.
Our focus will be on the role of version control, a cornerstone of DevOps practices, especially for data engineers. By the end of this lesson, you will have a solid understanding of version control systems like Git, their benefits, and their application in managing code versions and collaborating on data projects. 

DevOps seeks to improve collaboration and efficiency between development and operations teams.
<br>
DevOps, a combination of "Development" and "Operations," emerged as a set of practices aimed at bridging the gap between software development and IT operations.
<br>
DevOps advocates for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment, emphasising collaboration, automation, and monitoring throughout the software development lifecycle.

Distributed version control systems (DVCS), such as GIT, allow each developer to have a local copy of the entire repository. This feature facilitates collaboration as developers can work on their own repository and then synchronise with others

Version control is a pivotal aspect of DevOps, epitomising the principles of collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. 
It serves as the backbone for many DevOps practices, ensuring that software development and IT operations are seamlessly integrated. 
Furthermore, version control is crucial for implementing Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of data products.
Version control tracks changes, manages versions, and allows rollback to previous states, ensuring that any errors can be swiftly corrected without disrupting the entire system.

<b>Benefits of git include:</b> <br>
- Collaboration
- Code history
- Branching
- Merging

For data engineers, version control extends beyond code. It includes managing configuration files, SQL scripts, and data pipeline definitions. By using VCS, data engineers can maintain a history of changes, collaborate more effectively with team members, and ensure that data processing tasks are consistent and reproducible.

For data engineers, DevOps practices extend beyond managing code. 

They include maintaining data pipelines, managing configuration files, and ensuring that data processing tasks are consistent and reproducible.
