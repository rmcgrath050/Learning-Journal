# Security policy and incident response

Developing robust security policies is crucial for safeguarding information assets and ensuring compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.


Security policies cover various aspects of information security, including access control, data protection, and incident response. For instance, an access control policy defines who can access what information and under what conditions.
<br>
A data protection policy outlines how data should be handled, stored, and transmitted to ensure its security. An incident response policy provides a roadmap for handling security breaches and mitigating their impact
<br>
Policies highlight areas within security that need assistance, while procedures explain how that security area will be addressed.

<br>
A technology company implements an Acceptable Use Policy to ensure that employees use company resources responsibly. This policy helps in preventing misuse of the internet, reduces the risk of malware infections, and ensures compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Examples include:
- General information security policy - Provides a holistic view of the organisation's need for security and defines activities used within the security environment.

- Access security policy - Addresses how users are granted access to applications, data, databases and other IT resources. This policy is particularly important for audits.

- Authentication Policy - 
Governs how users are verified to access a system's resources

- Password Policy - Defines how passwords are configured and managed.

- Perimeter security policy - Defines how an organisation protects its network perimeter from unauthorized access and the technologies used to minimise perimeter porosity.

- Cybersecurity policy - Defines how an organisation prepares and responds to malware, phishing, viruses, ransomware and other attacks.

- Cloud security policy - Defines the security parameters for situations involving cloud-based technology, such as data storage and applications.

Patching policy - Defines the process for installing and managing patches for various systems, including security systems.

Physical access policy - Addresses how company assets, such as data centres, office buildings, parking garages and other physical facilities, are protected from unauthorized access.

Discrepancies and weaknesses in policies are often brought up during audits, so it's best to prepare in advance. It's also common for users to have safety concerns about their data and systems, so it's advised to set up security policies to employees and clients to alleviate their concerns.

Businesses normally follow these steps when preparing a security policy:
- Step 1: Identify the business purpose for having a specific type of IT security policy.
- Step 2: Secure approval from senior management to develop the policy.
- Step 3: Adapt existing security policies to maintain policy structure and format, and incorporate relevant components to address information security.
- Step 4: Establish a project plan to develop and approve the policy.
- Step 5: Create a team to develop the policy.
- Step 6: Schedule management briefings during the writing cycle to ensure relevant issues are addressed.
- Step 7: Invite internal departments to review the policy, particularly the legal team and HR.
- Step 8: Invite the risk management team to review the policy.
- Step 9: Distribute the draft for final review before submitting to management.
- Step 10: Secure management approval and disseminate the policy to employees.
- Step 11: Establish a review and change process for the policy using change management procedures.
- Step 12: Schedule and prepare for annual audits of the policy.
- Step 13: Make policy widely accessible via multiple channels



#### Additional details

• be developed by a team that can address operational, legal, competitive and other issues associated with information security;

• have input from internal departments on their security requirements;

• be discussed with HR to ensure uniform compliance by employees;

• be supported by senior management;

• specify who is eligible to access IT resources;

• specify security requirements for physical devices, such as laptops and firewalls;

• specify hardware and software security requirements;

• identify the frequency of change to security controls;

• be periodically tested, reviewed and updated to ensure relevance to the organization; and

• periodically be audited to ensure security controls are being followed.

Upon completion, the policy should be reviewed by IT management and the legal department. It's also important to circulate the policy to appropriate internal departments and external parties. Then, deploy the approved policy, and schedule ongoing review, audit and maintenance activities.

Security policies provide the necessary guidelines to manage and protect an organisation’s information assets effectively!!

## Implementing risk mitigation strategies

Here, we will explore various methods for assessing and reducing risks, best practices, and the use of open-source tools to strengthen your organisation’s security posture.
Implementing effective risk mitigation strategies ensures that vulnerabilities are addressed before they can be exploited by attackers, thereby safeguarding sensitive information and maintaining trust.
