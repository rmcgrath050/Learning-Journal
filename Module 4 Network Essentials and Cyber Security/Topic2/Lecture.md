CIA Traid is a framework that focueses on breaking down secuirty.

Above illustrates downtime for a day availibility. 5 9s is the aim for most companies for availability
Access is about protecting the lock not the data, the door itself is protected! 

### Authentication 

- includes encyrpted tokens JSON for session management
- MFA - What you know (password, pin), what you have (moblie, laptop) , who you are (biometric)
- For google cloud talk about microsoft authenicator on my phone to access cloud/ google recourses!
- Least privillege , better to build on privilage and build up rather than give everything and remove
- weakest link in chain is the actor (human)

## Encryption 

- application of keys
- One example of cryptography , uses algorithms to scramble (encrypt) and unscamble with keys
- A brute force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords, time is not on its side
- bit warden website tests your password, and tells u how long bruteforce takes
- encryption key , 1 issue is potientally getting lost, this also is a compromise
- Key maangement can be a issue , and computers / browsers can have an certificate, any data exchange there is always a certificate
- Certificate is software that manages the encrytion keys, it etstablishes trust! 
- Email is always encrypted
- Certicates  > local computer (can explore these here on local pc drive )
