# Introduction to networks for Data Engineers

### Key Definitions

- Router: A device that forwards data packets between computer networks, creating an overlay internetwork.
- Local Area Network (LAN): A network that connects computers within a limited area such as a residence, school, or office building.
- Access Point: A device that allows wireless devices to connect to a wired network using Wi-Fi or related standards.
- Firewall: A network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.

## TCP / IP and the OSI layer model

In the digital age, understanding network models such as TCP/IP and OSI is not just beneficial, it’s essential. These models serve as the backbone of internet communication, enabling data to be transmitted efficiently across diverse networks. The layered design of these models allows for systematic troubleshooting, speeding up the problem-solving process by isolating network issues effectively.

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is a set of rules that allows computers to communicate over the internet. Think of it as the language that computers use to talk to each other, ensuring that data sent from one computer arrives accurately and in the right order at another computer.

### TCP 
- Understanding TCP/IP helps you become more tech-savvy and better at troubleshooting connectivity issues.
- The TCP/IP model is fundamental in ensuring reliable data transmission across diverse networks.
- It serves as the backbone for internet communication by defining how data should be packetized, addressed, transmitted, routed, and received.
