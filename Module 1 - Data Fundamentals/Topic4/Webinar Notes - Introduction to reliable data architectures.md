# Introduction to reliable data architectures


<b>When working with data systems, what is your stragey for addressing?</b>
<br>
AWS/azure - manage space automically 
Data statgey where you an store data on cloud, and on site 
using modular scalable architecutre like microservices , data mesh etc. 

Leanring outcomes:
- Model standardised big data ecosystems and architectures for
enterprise data using visual approaches
- Describe the benefits of the three-layered architecture pattern
for organisational data management
- Describe how the microservices architecture style enables
organisations to build flexible, scalable, and resilient data
products
- Define architectural governance and its role in ensuring
reliability and compliance


architectural diagram covers system deails, design diagram focuses on 10:17 come back to this!!!!***

So design focuses on the how and architecture looks at the what (slide diargram incorrect) 

An Architecture Diagram 
- explains what your building
- how stakeholders will interact with it
- the constraints of the systems
- often drawn in layers

A Design Diagram
- more technical design
- normally does not have stakeholders
- Focuses on one part of the system and shows its building blocks


why use these diagrams?
- helps with planning
- understand what teams are needed in delivery
- defines structure and high level decisions that guide how the system is built
- easy to see how systems will flow to each other
- can be viewed though various levels

## Missue Deployment diagram 

- focus on secuirty , high level arch design
- Shows how attackers exploit weaknesses
-  Includes servers, databases, networks, and controls
-   Aids in proactive risk mitigation
-   Ensures data protection and system integrity

  Attacks include : SQL injection , spoofingetc. 
Risk migigation action such as gudies, phishing email checks
