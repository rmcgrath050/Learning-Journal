# Introduction to reliable data architectures


<b>When working with data systems, what is your stragey for addressing?</b>
<br>
AWS/azure - manage space automically 
Data statgey where you an store data on cloud, and on site 
using modular scalable architecutre like microservices , data mesh etc. 

Leanring outcomes:
- Model standardised big data ecosystems and architectures for
enterprise data using visual approaches
- Describe the benefits of the three-layered architecture pattern
for organisational data management
- Describe how the microservices architecture style enables
organisations to build flexible, scalable, and resilient data
products
- Define architectural governance and its role in ensuring
reliability and compliance


architectural diagram covers system deails, design diagram focuses on 10:17 come back to this!!!!***

So design focuses on the how and architecture looks at the what (slide diargram incorrect) 

An Architecture Diagram 
- explains what your building
- how stakeholders will interact with it
- the constraints of the systems
- often drawn in layers

A Design Diagram
- more technical design
- normally does not have stakeholders
- Focuses on one part of the system and shows its building blocks


why use these diagrams?
- helps with planning
- understand what teams are needed in delivery
- defines structure and high level decisions that guide how the system is built
- easy to see how systems will flow to each other
- can be viewed though various levels

## Missue Deployment diagram 

- focus on secuirty , high level arch design
- Shows how attackers exploit weaknesses
-  Includes servers, databases, networks, and controls
- Aids in proactive risk mitigation
- Ensures data protection and system integrity

  Attacks include : SQL injection , spoofingetc. 
Risk migigation action such as gudies, phishing email checks

<br>
The purpose of a UML component diagram is to show the relationship between different components in a system

<b>Drawning Tools </b>
- LucidChart (online)
- Microsoft Visio (part of MS Office)
- Dia (free software)
- Draw.io (cloud based)


<b>Tips </b>
- Version Control your diagrams â€“ they will evolve
- Simplify when possible, split when necessary

- Create logical groupings using polygons and colours
- Complement diagrams with descriptions
- Avoid too many acronyms
- You will normally have to explain the symbols you use


## Applying lenses, layers and chunks

## Architecture Problem Space

What is the current user experience or product?
- What are the problems?
- How can it be improved?
- What assumptions have you made?
- New product or user experience?
- How do you think your propose design ideas support, change or extend current ways of doing things?

## Data Mesh Principles

A mesh is a technical approach to distrubed data ownership.
Domian driven,  ecosytem Goverance, Self serve infrastructure as a Platform 

<b>Data silos (each owner having storage mine cant use it ) > central data > leads to data mesh </b>

## Summary 

- Architecture diagrams are crucial for managing complexity and change in data systems
- Diagrams help convey key system aspects, initiate discussions, and provide different perspectives
- Applying lenses, layers, and chunks enhances system comprehensibility and adaptability
- Public cloud computing offers powerful capabilities for reliable data architectures
- Data Mesh promotes decentralised data ownership and empowers domain-driven data management
