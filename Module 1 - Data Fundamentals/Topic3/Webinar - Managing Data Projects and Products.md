## Main Challenges of waterfall :
1. Diffuculity accommondating change
2. Lack of stakeholder Feedback

Other waterfall challenges:
- Very diffcuit to understand the length of long term projects 
- Can resist change
- Developement often takes longer than expected 
- must wait for user feedback 
tools used eg. MS Project


## Agile Principles
Frameworks like Scrum and Kanban help planning in DE, with emphasis with felxibility, responsivness and value
- close collaboration
- responding to change 
- iterative development 
- flexible planning 
- effective feedback loops 
- responsiveness to change 

<b>Tools used</b>: <br>
<b>Scrum</b> - broken up into sprints (broken up into 1-4 weeks, preagreed terms )
tools used eg. Atlassian Jira 
<br><b>Kanban</b> - visualation aspect, key aspects include the kanban board, limiting work in progress (WIP) and enhanacing project visiability 


### The Scum master
- Faciliate 
- improve 
- protect
- reward
- educate 
- encourage



### The Product Owner 
- Faciliate 
- improve 
- Protect 
- Decide 
- Scrope 
- Vision

## Sprint Planning
- debate focused

A burnout chart is a visual representation of the work remaining in a sprint or project over time

### Scrum Boars and Sprint Backlog

A scrum board represents backlog why to do , in porgress and done columns<br>
Also can have develop test, deploy columns<br>
Backlog grooming  - onngoing frooming means backlog items are sprint ready

<b>Sprint review</b> - geeting feedback at end of sprint, what we have done<br> 
<b>Sprint Retrospectivie<b/> - How we could have done better, what worked well, what we can commit to do in next sprint? <br>

## Defination of Done

## Writing User Stories

What is a user story? <br>
at end sprint, user stories is expected outcomes of the user, 
bringing user requirements to life with specific examples 


Consider:
-  Specificity
-  Acceptance criteria
-  User perspective
-  Objectives
-  INVEST, independable, negotiable, Valuable, estimable, 


### User Story Checklist

Epic user stories is a high level description, which then is broken down into components

### Lean Pillars <br>

### Lean Software Development<br> 
<br>

While Lean emphasises waste reduction and process optimisation, Six Sigma targets quality improvement. Let's explore how these methodologies differ and how they can be applied in the context of data engineering and analytics.

### Following Lean principles can help to: 

Lean:
- Identify and address data quality issues, such as missing values, outliers, or inconsistencies
- Streamline data collection, pre-processing, and transformation workflows to improve efficiency
- Avoid running resources that are not being efficiently utilised
- Prevent data pipelines from being used for unnecessary tasks

Six Sigma:
- Continuously monitor and optimise data pipelines and analytical models to maintain high performance
- Establish rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data-driven insights
- Implement statistical process control techniques to identify and address root causes of data quality issues


Lean methodologies encourage the elimination of non-value-adding activities and focus on streamlining processes. 
In the context of identifying data sources and understanding data processing concepts and methods, Lean can facilitate quicker and more efficient decision-making regarding which data sources to prioritise and which data processing methods are most efficient for the task at hand. 

Six Sigma adds to this by using data-driven techniques to identify variances in data quality and processing efficiency, allowing for a more precise selection of data sources and methodologies.

example : The firm applies the Define, Measure, Analyse, Improve, and Control (DMAIC) process of Six Sigma to the data cleansing process. 

This is how they did it:

1. Define: The objective is clearly defined as reducing inaccuracies in transaction data.
2. Measure: Current error rates are measured.
3. Analyse: The root causes of data inaccuracies are identified (e.g., incorrect data entry, outdated information).
4. Improve: Solutions are implemented, such as automated data validation checks and regular data quality audits.
5. Control: New standards and controls are established to maintain the improved data quality level.
6. Benefit: The structured approach leads to significantly reduced inaccuracies, enhancing the effectiveness of fraud detection algorithms. This results in reduced operational losses and improved customer trust.

The "5 Whys" technique is used to systematically identify the root cause of a problem by asking "why" repeatedly, helping to address underlying issues rather than surface symptoms.

## Lesson 6: Effective stakeholder engagement

User-centric requirements capture: Utilise concise, human-centric user stories to capture stakeholder needs and ensure data solutions are aligned with end-user requirements

Qualitative and observational insights: Combine structured interviews, focus groups, and direct observations to gather in-depth, nuanced understanding of user needs and pain points

Collaborative workshops and personas - Foster a shared understanding of user needs through collaborative workshops and the development of detailed user personas

User stories are an effective tool for capturing stakeholder requirements in a concise, user-centric manner, helping to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders. 


## Summary

- Agile methodologies offer greater flexibility and responsiveness to change compared to the linear Waterfall approach, making them well-suited for dynamic data science projects

- Scrum and Kanban provide structured Agile frameworks that empower data teams to collaborate effectively, manage workflows, and continuously improve their processes

- Lean principles focus on eliminating waste and optimising processes, while Six Sigma aims to reduce variability and defects

- Comprehensive stakeholder engagement, through methods like user stories, interviews, and collaborative workshops, is crucial for aligning data solutions with the needs of end-users and business stakeholders

- The sprint retrospective is a valuable Scrum ceremony that fosters a culture of continuous learning, empowering data teams to openly discuss successes, failures, and implement insights for ongoing improvement
