Can you think of any metrics that could be tracked to provide valuable data-driven insights in your organisation
(these can be HR-related or something else)?

1. Customer acquisition and retention rates
2. Sales productivity and revenue metrics
3. Compliance and risk management indicators
4. Employee certification and licensing data
5. Branch/office performance and efficiency metrics

 Additionally, it's crucial to consider industry best practices and benchmarks when selecting and analysing these metrics.


##The transition from small to big data
1. Overwhelming data: Simple tools and databases that once sufficed for data storage and analysis become inadequate.
2. Performance bottlenecks: Existing systems may struggle to process data efficiently, leading to delays and reduced productivity.
3. Missed opportunities: The inability to leverage data for predictive insights or to identify trends and patterns, which are crucial for strategic planning.


##The Characteristics of Data
--had some of my own notes to add from lecture here 

The 5 Vs of data offer a simple framework to grasp these fundamental attributes: 
volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value

Velocity: Refers to the speed at which data is generated, collected, and processed.
Veracity: Refers to the reliability and accuracy of the data.
