Column Description

What are the two credibility issues with this dataset and why are they important?
Missing coverage refers to gaps or incomplete representations within a dataset, leading to biased or skewed results as the 
analysis may not capture the full picture.
Missing provenance, on the other hand, means a lack of information about the data's origin, sources, and transformations, 
making it difficult to assess the trustworthiness and accuracy of the data, as well as trace back and address any potential 
issues or errors.

Tags to explain the dataset is also very useful! 'Clean dataset',
